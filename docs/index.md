# Introduction

GreenPlate is an app designed to help reduce the waste of food, save people money by helping them utilize all of the food that they buy, and help people track their daily calorie intake. Greenplate is dedicated to aiding people in their everyday food management plans. To help create more sustainable habits, the app allows users to be able to digitally track food items in their pantry, generate recipes to help ensure that all items in the pantry get eaten, and create shopping lists so that a user does not accidentally purchase food items that already are in their pantry. By shopping and planning meals with sustainability in mind, users can save money and more affordably feed themselves and their families. In addition to eating and shopping sustainability, the GreenPlate app also provides users with information on their calorie intake. Users can use this knowledge to help them reach their eating goals and establish healthy eating habits. GreenPlateâ€™s overarching purpose is to increase food efficiency one pantry at a time.


# Design and Architecture

Here we have the use case diagram for our first sprint where we were defining how primary and supporting actors would interact with the app, and who could potentially be supporting the development and production of the app. The user being a primary actor in this diagram interacts with the app by logging into the app, entering in their calorie intake to be recorded, adding items to their shopping list, and selecting a recipe to cook. Understanding how the different actors such as the user interact with the system allowed the development of the GreenPlate app to go smoothly by providing a consistent description of what needed to be implemented down the road.
